gamepads.js
===========

**Version 0.1**

This is very early in development and is not meant for public consumption.  If you do use it, it only works for the latest versions of Chrome.

A library seeking to remove the frustration from using gamepads in JavaScript.  This is not a shim, but seeks to make it easier to work gamepads in general.
