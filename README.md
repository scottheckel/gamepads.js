gamepads.js
===========

**Version 0.2 (in development)**

This is very early in development and is not meant for public consumption. If you do use it, it only works for the latest versions of Chrome (22 and newer).

A library seeking to remove the frustration from using gamepads in JavaScript. This is not a shim, but seeks to make it easier to work gamepads in general. After being disappointed in the support of what is currently out there and the differences between browsers of how they support this early in-development API.
